HTML
It's a markup language that can be written in any simple text editor. You doesn't need a program to write your html code.
It is a markup language because it uses tags to say how the text between them should appear in the page.

 Notice that tags and attribute names are lowercase. 
 HTML is not case sensitive but itâ€™s good practice to leave them lowercase.
 
 We have TAGS, ATTRIBUTES, VALUES and CONTENT.
 <tag atrributes="values">Content</tag>

Hints about content:
<h1> = main heading
<a> = link
<img> = images


Basic Elements of HTML Language

<!DOCTYPE html> 
This element is telling which version of html is being used (document type declaration).

<html>
This element is the container for all the other html tags.
It can store an atribute called language (lang) that is organized: <html lang="pt-BR"></html>



  <head>
  This element contains elements that tell about the page rather than what's on the page.
	
	<meta>
	It is organized with only the opnening tag (VOID ELEMENT). Meta tags can contain some attributes like:
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	Charset attribute tells computers how to interpret digital data into letters, numbers and symbols. It is standard to use utf-8. 
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0">
	This viewport element ensures the page renders at the width of viewport, preventing mobile browsers from rendering pages wider than the viewport and then shrinking them down.

	<title>
	This element inside of <head> contains a text that will show up in the title bar or tab at the top of the browse window (not in the page itself).



  <body>
  The body tag is where all the elements that make up the page will go
	
	<header>
	This element contains the things that will appear in the top of the page (the header). These things will remain the same from one page to another.
	
		<nav>
		This element contains the navigation elements (links) that will appear in the header. Usually, they contain "a elements".
		   
		   <a> elements
		   They are hyperlinks contained in the navigation elements. When the user clicks on the text or content between the <a> tags, it will take them somewhere else.
		   Additional information is needed inside the opening tag to specify where to send the user once they click the content, this is called an attribute. Attributes usually come in name/value pairs, with the name followed by an equal sign and then the value in quotes.
		   Example:
		   <a href="index.html">Home</a>
		   In this example, the opening tag has the attribute "href", and it has the value "index.html".
		   After the opening tag, we have the content of this link: the text "Home" will be displayed.
		   Something about hyperlinks:
		   The # value for the Home page href anchor link refers to the current page and will not reload the page.
		   	
	<main>
	This element contains the things that will be unique to each page of the website.
		<p>
		This is a paragraph element. We write the text content between the opening and closing tags. 
	
	
	
		<img>
		To the images, we only need the opening tag, because the content is handled by the attributes. (VOID ELEMENT)
		Example:
		<img src="voyager.jpg" alt="docking station">
		This image tag has two attributes: src (source) and alt (alternative text).
		Source = where the image is located
		Alternative text = this will be the alternative for the image if there is a screen reader or if the image is not available.
	
	<footer>
	This element contains the things that will appear in the bottom of the page. These things will remain the same from one page to another.





IMPORTANT!
What is the basic anatomy of an HTML document that is required for all pages in this course?

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
