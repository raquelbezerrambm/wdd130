      <p>I am Raquel Bezerra, 21 years old. I'm from Natal, Brazil, 
        but I'm living in Fortaleza, Ceará, since 2010. I served from December 
        2022 until May 2024 in the glorious Brazil Maceió Mission.
        I like painting, listening to music, going to the Temple, and 
        going to the beach early in the morning.</p>

        Ceará is a state in the North East of Brazil. It is mostly known by 
        the hot climate and beautiful beaches (the image shows Iracema's Beach, 
        in Fortaleza, the Capital City of Ceará State). There are two main footbal 
        teams that the population in Ceará cheers up: Fortaleza (also known as "Leão" - lion in English), 
        and Ceará (also known as "Vozão" - big grandpa in English).
