      <p>Hello world! I am Raquel Bezerra, 21 years old. I'm from Natal, Brazil, 
        but I'm living in Fortaleza, Ceará, since 2010. I live with my parents and my three 
        siblings. I have an older brother, and two little sisters. I served from December 
        2022 until May 2024 in the glorious Brazil Maceió Mission. I like to say that it was
        litteraly an adventure. Sometimes I felt like Frodo Baggins, from the Lord of the Rings,
        trying to carry a huge burden alone, but the Lord helped me to feel the love of my
        companions, just like Frodo felt the love and had the help of Samwise Gamgee.
        I like painting, listening to music, going to the Temple, and 
        going to the beach early in the morning.
        I started studying at BYU Pathway in 2021, before my mission.
        Now that I arrived, I chose to continue my studies at BYU-Idaho as 
        an online student. I am taking the Software Development Bachelor's 
        degree. This is being one of the most interesting experiences I have 
        ever had, I'm learning so many new things.</p>

        Ceará is a state in the North East of Brazil. It is mostly known by 
        the hot climate and beautiful beaches (the image shows Iracema's Beach, 
        in Fortaleza, the Capital City of Ceará State). There are two main footbal 
        teams that the population in Ceará cheers up: Fortaleza (also known as "Leão" - lion in English), 
        and Ceará (also known as "Vozão" - big grandpa in English).
