        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Splash Rafting Company started as an idea in the winter of 2010, when Kyle Vie went to the Cold River with his family. He was just 14 years old at that time. When they arrived there, he felt that there was no better place to be, because he was with the nature and with the ones he loved. When they went down rafting through the Cold River, Kyle felt the water drops in his face, the cold wind in his skin, and the paddles in his hands. He heard the laughter of his siblings, and saw the smile on their faces. What a wonderful and soft moment, he could contemplate the most beautiful things God gave him. </p>

        <p>Kyle Vie never forgot this experience, he wanted for everyone to have the same feelings he had at the Cold River in 2010. This is why he started thinking of something he could do to help people to have this awesome experience with their family and friends. When he went to the college, Kyle started studying business, so he could fulfill this dream. That was the time when he met his wife, Rayal Astrid, a rafting lover. They started building together what would become our beloved Splash. Today, Splash Rafting Company helps hundreds of families to have the same feelings Kyle had when he was 14 years old.</p>
